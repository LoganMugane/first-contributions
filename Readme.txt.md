<strong>Branching Repositories</strong><br>
One of gits strongest features is its branching capabilities. Due to branching being cheaper than centralized version control systems as well as being easier to merge allows  Git users to use the feature branch workflow.  Feature branches give Git users an isolated environment to make changes to their code base. Every time a user wants to work on something new all they have to do is create a new branch. This ensures that the master branch always has production-quality code. Git being a distributed version control system means that programmers working on a project each get their own local repositories or branches  with a complete history of commits. This allows the programmers to be able to accesses to a local history, as well as allowing the programmer to work without a network connection.</p>
